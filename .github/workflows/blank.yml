# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

env:
  AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_NAME: 'your-app-name'   # set this to your function app name on Azure
  AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: '.'       # set this to the path to your function app project, defaults to the repository root
  PYTHON_VERSION: '3.9'                     # set this to the python version to use (e.g. '3.6', '3.7', '3.8')

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
